    <p>
I am working at the Kiel University as a PhD Student since November 2020 in the Department of Computer Science. 
My Research Group is "Programming Languages and Compiler Construction", where I am working under <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/">Prof. Dr. Michael Hanus</a>. 
You can find contact details at <a href="https://www.ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/en/team/m-sc-kai-prott">my department page</a>.

### Interests and Projects
I am interested in Functional programming (preferrably with Haskell) and compiler tooling.
In the past I have also worked a bit with Coq and on high-performance numerical computations with CPU and GPU.  

My current project is a plugin for GHC that adds an implicit monadic effect to a language. The tool aims to simplify developmenmt of research languages/DSLs and to provide a tight integration with Haskell. The project is currently unpublished (see below), but the tool is available at https://github.com/cau-placc/ghc-language-plugin. 
Within this project I learned a lot about the internals of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. 
I also contributed a small patch to GHC for an [itch](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20671) that bothered me. 

### Publications 
- [Haskell⁻¹: automatic function inversion in Haskell](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3471874.3472982) (2021, F. Teegen, K. Prott, N. Bunkenburg)
- Master's Thesis: [Extending the Glasgow Haskell Compiler for functional-logic Programs with Curry-Plugin](https://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/lehre/abschlussarbeiten/msc/Prott.pdf) (2020, K. Prott)

Yet to be published: 
- A project on using a plugin to add an implicit monadic effect to Haskell code (https://github.com/cau-placc/ghc-language-plugin).
- A project on modeling Curry as a monad with memoization to increase runtime performance (https://github.com/cau-placc/curry-monad).
